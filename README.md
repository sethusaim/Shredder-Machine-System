# Shredder Machine Safety System

## Problem Statement : 
In processing industries, like Waste Management,accidents occurred when a worker was feeding paper into a shredder machine and did not release the paper in time to prevent the fingers from entering the shredder opening. As paper shredder continued to pull the paper into the shredder opening, it also pulled in the workerâ€™s fingers. Providing safety to workers who works on paper shredder machine using computer vision hand detection.
